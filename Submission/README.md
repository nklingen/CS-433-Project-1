### How to create a submission (out.csv file) using our best method
In the same folder:    
`unzip test.csv.zip`    
`unzip train.csv.zip`    
`python3 run.py`   

##### The `run.py` script:     
- Loads the training data   
- Splits training data with ratio 0.8   
- Runs ridge regression to compute the combination of degree / lambda with the lowest validation MSE   
- Predicts labels for the test data   
- Saves this predictions in the `out.csv` submission file   

Please note that the degree and lambda values fluctuate very slightly between   
runs (hence there may be a small descepancy between the recorded parameter values    
in the report and those calculated by run.py) though the output consistently has an accuracy of 78.9%


##### The `run_all_methods.py` script:
- Loads the training data   
- Splits training data with ratio 0.8  
- Standardize the input data  
- Runs all the required ML functions and print their accuracy   
- Predicts labels for the test data
